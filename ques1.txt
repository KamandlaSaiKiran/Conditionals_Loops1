Conditional Statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.
IF statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
Example is:
if(10>5){
    var outcome="if block";
}
output is: if block is printed when we try to print the outcome varaible.
ELSE statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.
if("cat"==="dog){
    var outcome="if block";
}
else {
    var outcome="else block";
}
output is : else block is printed when try to print the outcome variable.
ELSE IF statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.
if(false){
    var outcome="if block";

} 
else if(true){
    var outcome="else if block";
}
else {
    var outcome="else block"
}
output is: else if block is printed when we try to print the outcome vaeiable.
